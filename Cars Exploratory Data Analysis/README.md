# Automobile Data Analysis
## Problem Description 
Let's say we have a friend name Tom. And Tom wants to sell his car. But the problem is he doesn't know how much he should sell his car for. Tom wants to sell his car for as much as he can. But he also wants to set the price reasonably, so someone would want to purchase it. So, the price he sets should represent the value of the car.
How can we help Tom determine the best price for his car? Let's think like data scientists and clearly define some of his problems. For example: 
- Is there data on the prices of other cars and their characteristics? 
-	What features of cars affect their prices? 
-	Does horsepower also effect the selling price, or perhaps something else like Color or Brand? 
As a Data Analyst or Data Scientist, these are some of the questions we can start thinking about.
## Goal
The goal of this project is to determine which car features that best predict its price.

Just a quick note the dataset is actually from 1985.
